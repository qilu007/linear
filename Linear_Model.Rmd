```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(
    boro = neighbourhood_group,
    neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, boro, neighborhood, room_type)
```


fit a first linear model 
```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)

```

```{r}
fit
summary(fit)
coef(fit)
summary(fit)$coef

```
 tidy the result
```{r}
fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "boro","Boro:")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)

fit %>% 
  broom::glance()
# glance exists
```
 
## Take a look at factors

```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    boro = fct_infreq(boro),
    room_type = fct_infreq(room_type)
  )
```

refit the last model
```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)
fit %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
